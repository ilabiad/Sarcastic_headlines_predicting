One should download the glove.6B.zip and extract in the root of this repository, the size of the folder is unfortunatly too large for github so I didn't include it
here is the link for the download: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

I also removed some pretrained weights for the models cause they were too large and didn't wont to go in the trouble of storing them in downloadable links especially since they are not necessary
